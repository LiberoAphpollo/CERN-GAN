# CaloGAN
Simulating 3D High Energy Particle Showers in Multi-Layer Electromagnetic Calorimeters with Generative Adversarial Networks ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02355))

## Goal
The goal of this project is to help physicists at CERN speed up their simulations by encoding the most computationally expensive portion of the simulation process (i.e., showering in the EM calorimeter) in a deep generative model.

The challenges come from the fact that this portion of the detector is longitudinally segmented into three layers with heterogeneous granularity. For simplicity, we can visualize the energy depositions of particles passing through the detector as a series of three images per shower, while keeping in mind the sequential nature of their relationship in the generator. 

To download and better understand the training dataset, visit the [Mendeley Data repository](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pvn3xc3wy5/1).

## Getting Started

This repository contains three main folders: `generation`, `models` and `analysis`, which represent the three main stages in this project. You may decide to only engage in a subset of them, so we decided to provide you with all you need to jump right in at the level you are interested in. 

`generation` contains the code to build the electromagnetic calorimeter geometry and shoot particles at it with a give energy. This is all based on `Geant4`. For more instructions, go to [Generation on PDSF](#generation-on-pdsf).

`models` contains the core ML code for this project. The file [`train.py`](https://github.com/hep-lbdl/CaloGAN/blob/master/models/train.py) takes care of loading the data and training the GAN. 

`analysis` contains Jupyter Notebooks used to evaluate performance and produce all plots for the paper.

## Generation on PDSF

On [PDSF](http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/pdsf/), your should run all generation code that outputs big files to a scratch space. To make a scratch environment, run `mkdir /global/projecta/projectdirs/atlas/{your-username}`, and for convenience, link to home via `ln -s /global/projecta/projectdirs/atlas/{your-username} ~/scratch`.

To build the generation code on PDSF, simply run `source cfg/pdsf-env.sh` from the `generation/` folder in the repository. This loads modules.

Next, you can type `make` which should build an executable called `generate`. Because of how Geant4 works, this executable gets deposited in `$HOME/geant4_workdir/bin/Linux-g++/`, which is in your `$PATH` when the modules from `cfg/pdsf-env.sh` are loaded.	

To run the generation script, run `generate -m cfg/run2.mac`. You can change generation parameters inside [`cfg/run2.mac`](https://github.com/hep-lbdl/CaloGAN/blob/master/generation/cfg/run2.mac)

To launch a batch job on PDSF, simply run `./launch <num_jobs>`, to launch `<num_jobs>` concurrent tasks in a job array.

## The CaloGAN Model
This work builds on the solution presented in [arXiv/1701.05927](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05927) which we named LAGAN, or Location-Aware Generative Adversarial Network. This is a Physics specific modification of the more common DCGAN and ACGAN frameworks which is specifically designed to handle the levels of sparsity, the location dependence, and the high dynamic range that characterizes Physics images.

# Training the CaloGAN model
The most important step in the training process is creating a YAML file with the specification in [`models/particles.yaml`](https://github.com/hep-lbdl/CaloGAN/blob/master/models/particles.yaml) for all the particles you want to train on. **In the paper, we only train on one at a time.** If you train on more than one, it trains an ACGAN, which we found to not be performant. Assuming that you have a folder called `data/` in the root directory of the project, and you have a file inside (downloaded from Mendeley, perhaps?) called `eplus.h5`, you can train your own CaloGAN by running 

```bash
python -m models.train models/particles.yaml
```

I recommend running `python -m models.train -h` at least once to see all the parameters one can change. 

### Generator
![Generator](figures/caloGAN_gen.jpg)
The Generator contains three parallel LAGAN-style streams with an in-painting mechanism to handle the sequential nature of these shower images.
### Discriminator
![Discriminator](figures/caloGAN_discr_rev.jpg)
The discriminator uses convolutional features combined with ad-hoc notions of sparsity and reconstructed energy to classify real and fake images as well as comparing the reconstructred energy with the condition requested by the user.
